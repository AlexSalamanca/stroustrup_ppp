Exercises from Stroustrup's "Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++" (First Edition). Some sample solutions by Stroustrup can be found [here](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html).

I was working with Visual Studio 2013 Express for Chapters 1-18, then I changed to Code::Blocks. Everything I've uploaded here was tested to compile in Code::Blocks using MinGW GCC 4.8.1.

Chapters 12-16 deal with GUI/graphics and use [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/index.php).
