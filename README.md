Exercises from Stroustrup's ["Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++" (First Edition)](http://www.informit.com/store/programming-principles-and-practice-using-c-plus-plus-9780321543721). Some sample solutions by Stroustrup can be found [here](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html).

I was working with Visual Studio 2013 Express for Chapters 1-18, then I changed to [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org). Everything I've uploaded here was tested to compile in Code::Blocks using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) GCC 4.8.1.

Chapters 12-16 deal with GUI/graphics and use [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/index.php). The actual work there is not in the files containing `main`, but in Graph.cpp, GUI.cpp and Simple_window.cpp.
